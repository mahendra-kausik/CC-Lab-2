## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Checkout Route Optimization (`/checkout`)

**Bottleneck:** Inefficient loop logic in fee calculation
- Original code used `while fee > 0:` loop with `total += 1` and `fee -= 1`
- This created O(n) time complexity where n = sum of all event fees
- For large fees (e.g., 1000), this meant 1000 iterations per fee

**Change:** Replaced with direct fee summation
```python
Before: while fee > 0: total += 1; fee -= 1

After: for e in events: total += e[0]
```

**Why performance improved:** 
- Reduced time complexity from O(sum of fees) to O(number of events)
- Eliminated unnecessary arithmetic operations
- Direct addition instead of repetitive incrementing

### 2. Events Route Optimization (`/events`)

**Bottleneck:** Unnecessary computational waste loop
- 3,000,000 iterations of `waste += i % 3` calculation
- CPU-intensive operations blocking request processing

**Change:** Removed the entire wasteful computation
```python
Before: 
waste = 0 
for i in range(3000000): 
    waste += i % 3

After: Removed completely
```

**Why performance improved:**
- Eliminated 3M arithmetic operations per request
- Removed artificial CPU blocking
- Response time reduced from seconds to milliseconds

### 3. My Events Route Optimization (`/my-events`)

**Bottleneck:** Dummy counter loop
- 1,500,000 iterations of `dummy += 1` increment
- Artificial computational delay serving no purpose

**Change:** Removed the entire dummy computation
```python
Before: 
dummy = 0
for _ in range(1500000): 
    dummy += 1

After: Removed completely  
```

**Why performance improved:**
- Eliminated 1.5M increment operations per request
- Removed unnecessary CPU cycles
- Immediate response after database query completion

## Performance Testing
Use Locust for load testing:
- Events route: `locust -f locust/events_locustfile.py`
- My Events route: `locust -f locust/myevents_locustfile.py` 
- Checkout route: `locust -f locust/checkout_locustfile.py`

## Key Learnings
1. **Avoid unnecessary computations** in request handlers
2. **Optimize algorithmic complexity** for better scalability
3. **Profile and measure** performance before and after changes
4. **Simple optimizations** can yield dramatic improvements
